# CardMarket Scraper

A lightweight Python scraper for Cardmarket that scans seller inventories and checks for matches with a user-provided list of trading cards.

## Features
- Scan automatically with support for Cloudflare rate limits (auto-wait)
- Supports YuGiOh (Y), Magic (M), and Pokemon (P)
- Displays results in a formatted table and lists cards not found

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or newer
- Libraries:
  - `cloudscraper`
  - `beautifulsoup4`

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/o7-7/cardmarket-scraper.git
cd cardmarket-scraper
pip install cloudscraper beautifulsoup4
```

Alternatively, create a `requirements.txt` with:

```
cloudscraper
beautifulsoup4
```

and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the script with the game code, seller name, and either a single card or a text file of card names (one per line):

```bash
python CardMarket_scraper.py [GAME_CODE] SELLER_NAME CARD_OR_FILE
```

- `GAME_CODE`: `Y` for YuGiOh, `M` for Magic, `P` for Pokemon
- `SELLER_NAME`: Cardmarket seller username
- `CARD_OR_FILE`: single card name or path to a `.txt` file with a list of cards

### Card List Format
If you use a `.txt` file for your card list, each line should follow this format:

```
card_name1\tnote1
card_name2
card_name3\tnote3
```

- Each card name is mandatory.
- You can optionally add personal notes after the card name by separating them with a **tab character** (`\t`).
- Notes are ignored by the scraper but can help you organize your list.

**Example file content:**

```
Dark Magician\t1st Edition
Blue-Eyes White Dragon
Red-Eyes Black Dragon\tJapanese Version
```

## Example Command

```bash
python CardMarket_scraper.py Y bestSeller card_list.txt
```
